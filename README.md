### The Beginning
About a year ago, I started my very own home server for various services like nextcloud and jellyfin on a very old HP laptop running Debian 11 with docker containers. It had 4 core CPU, 6GB of DDR3 RAM, and 1TB of hard drive space on a 2.5 mechanical drive (model: 15-ba079dx). It was very simple and power-efficient.

But eventually I wanted something with more storage and power to run a hypervisor like proxmox while at the same time still being power-efficient (under 30 watts). Why a hypervisor? It would allow me to run some services that are hard to configure perfectly inside LXD or docker containers. So taking an very old desktop case, gutting it, then putting better and power-efficient componenents, I present you my server!
