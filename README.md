### The Beginning
About a year ago, I started my very own home server for various services like nextcloud and jellyfin on a very old HP laptop running Debian 11 with docker containers. It had 4 core CPU, 6GB of DDR3 RAM, and 1TB of hard drive space on a 2.5 mechanical drive (model: 15-ba079dx). It was very simple and power-efficient.
